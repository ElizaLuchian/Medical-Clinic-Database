# Medical-Clinic-Database
This project involves the design, documentation, and implementation of a Database Management System (DBMS) for a clinic. The system efficiently stores and manages clinic-related data such as patients, doctors, appointments, and treatments. The database is designed using an Entity-Relationship (ER) model, and it has been implemented using Oracle APEX.
